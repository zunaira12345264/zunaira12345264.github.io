    <h1>DEMO PAGE </h1>
    <p>Do you have awesome software product ideas you would like to build? Do you need a great software engineer with over 20 years of experience on your team to help with different software projects? You are in the right place! As a one-person-army software engineer, I can build variants of software products from the ground up. Front-end Engineer, Backend-Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and Mobile Engineer, it will be very expensive to hire all of them, and the communication would be challenging. But if you hire me, I am the only person you need to talk to, and I can do all of it by myself. See some of my works here to get an idea of how wide the scope I can cover. Please get in touch with me via the following email if you are interested in the software development contracting service I provide: fangpen@launchplatform.com</p>
